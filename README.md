# Nature-Travel

For this project, I used Bootstrap 5, where I focused on the design of the page and its functionality.
Bootstrap 5 is a great tool to make web pages load faster and ensures that they are responsive for all screen sizes. 
This site is responsive for all screen sizes. 
It has videos added, some beautiful images, and many more cool stuff. 
Please, feel free to check it out. 
This was a great challenge for me.
